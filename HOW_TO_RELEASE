* RW access to the git repository
* Credential to the deploy server in settings.xml
* The parent POM should be at the root of the repository (otherwise git add does not work)

mvn --batch-mode release:prepare -DreleaseVersion=1.0.0 -DdevelopmentVersion=1.1.0-SNAPSHOT

mvn release:perform

NOTE:
The release:perform will fail because it tried to create the JNLP but the realease will be deployed anyway. 
Need to see how to create the JNLP at the same time.
